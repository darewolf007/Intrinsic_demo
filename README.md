## Overview

**DEMO<sup>3</sup>** is a framework that incorporates multi-stage dense reward learning, a bi-phasic training scheme, and world model learning into a carefully designed demonstration-augmented RL algorithm. Our evaluations demonstrate that our method improves data efficiency by an average of **40%** and by **70%** on particularly difficult tasks compared to state-of-the-art approaches. We validate this across 16 sparse-reward tasks spanning four domains, including challenging humanoid visual control tasks using as few as five demonstrations.

This repository contains code for training and evaluating **DEMO<sup>3</sup>**, MoDem, and TD-MPC2 agents. We additionally open-source **20+** multi-stage tasks across 4 task domains: [Meta-World](https://meta-world.github.io/), [ManiSkill3](https://maniskill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) and [RoboSuite](https://robosuite.ai/). Our codebase supports both state and pixel observations. We hope that this repository will serve as a useful community resource for future research on demonstration-augmented RL.

----

## Getting started

You will need a machine with a GPU and at least 12 GB of RAM for state-based RL with DEMO<sup>3</sup> and 32 GB of RAM for pixel-based observations. The GPU must be able to support CUDA 12.4 as a minimum.

We provide a `Dockerfile` for easy installation. You can build the docker image by running

```
cd docker && docker build . -t <user>/DEMO3:1.0.0
```

This docker image contains all dependencies needed for running ManiSkill3, Meta-World and Robosuite experiments.

If you prefer to install dependencies manually, start by installing dependencies via `conda` by running the following command:

```
conda env create -f docker/environment.yaml
```

The `environment.yaml` file installs dependencies required for training on ManiSkill and Meta-World tasks. Since Meta-Wolrd uses a version of Robosuite that is incompatible with the MuJoCo version, we install a separate conda environment for these domains. The `robosuite.yaml` file installs dependencies required for training on Robosuite tasks.

----

## Supported tasks

This codebase currently supports **20+** continuous manipulation tasks from **ManiSkill3**, **Meta-World** and **Robosuite**. Specifically, we modify these manipulation tasks. See the below table for the expected name formatting for each task domain:

| domain | task | reward type
| --- | --- | --- |
| metaworld | mw-assembly-dense         | dense
| metaworld | mw-pick-place-wall-semi   | semi-sparse
| maniskill | ms-stack-cube-dense       | dense
| maniskill | ms-pick-place-semi        | semi-sparse
| robosuite | robosuite-lift-dense      | dense
| robosuite | robosuite-stack-semi      | semi-sparse


which can be run by specifying the `task` argument for `evaluation.py` or `train.py`. To change the observation type, use the argument `obs=rgb` or `obs=state` in `demo3.yaml` or `eval.yaml`.


## Example usage

We provide examples of how to evaluate our provided DEMO<sup>3</sup> checkpoints, as well as how to train your own DEMO<sup>3</sup> agents below.

### Evaluation

See the below examples on how to evaluate pre-trained checkpoints. See `eval.yaml` for a complete list of arguments.

```
$ python demo3/evaluate.py task=ms-stack-cube-semi checkpoint=/path/to/stack-cube.pt save_video=true
$ python demo3/evaluate.py task=mw-assembly-dense checkpoint=/path/to/assembly.pt save_video=true
```

### Collecting Demonstrations

You can collect demonstrations using the `demo3/evaluate.py` script. To save observations in RGB while running state-based policies, set the `obs` and `obs_save` parameters accordingly.

You'll need a **DEMO3** or **TD-MPC2** checkpoint. Pre-trained **TD-MPC2** checkpoints for some Maniskill tasks are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SQukMBzW2D-aeS_7X_7GbGGaEoqEGKeu?usp=sharing). Then, run the following command, specifying the task, checkpoint path, and enabling `save_trajectory`:

```
$ python demo3/evaluate.py task=ms-stack-cube-semi checkpoint=/path/to/stack-cube.pt save_video=true save_trajectory=true obs="state" obs_save="rgb"
$ python demo3/evaluate.py task=ms-humanoid-transport-box-semi checkpoint=/path/to/humanoid-transport-box.pt save_video=true save_trajectory=true obs="state" obs_save="rgb"
```

### Training

See below examples on how to train DEMO<sup>3</sup> on multi-stage tasks. We recommend configuring [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai) (`wandb`) in `demo3.yaml` to track training progress.

```
$ python demo3/train.py task=ms-stack-cube-semi steps=1000000 demo_path=/path/to/ms-demos/stack-cube-200.pkl enable_reward_learning=true
$ python demo3/train.py task=mw-assembly-semi steps=500000 obs=rgb demo_path=/path/to/mw-demos/assembly-200.pkl enable_reward_learning=true
```

We recommend using default hyperparameters for single-task online RL from the official TD-MPC2 implementation, although they can be modified in `tdmpc2.yaml`. Alternatively, the backbone algorithm TD-MPC2 can be run by deactivating reward learning, demonstration oversampling and policy pretraining:

```
$ python demo3/train.py task=ms-stack-cube-semi steps=1000000 enable_reward_learning=false demo_sampling_ratio=0.0 policy_pretraining=False
```
